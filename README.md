# Education Analytics Dashboard for Mathnasium 

This is a dashboard project to enable managers at Mathnasium to see key metrics in one location. This will aid in tracking student progress and retention.

mathDash_s3.py contains main dashboard code. This involves downloading scraped and cleaned data from AWS S3 cloud storage.

A separate scraping script was made to maintain updated data in the dashboard and S3.
